# Diabetes Prediction

This project uses **machine learning** to predict whether a person is diabetic based on health-related attributes. It involves data preprocessing, model training with Support Vector Machine (SVM), and evaluation using accuracy metrics.  

## Project Workflow
1. **Import Dependencies** — NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn.  
2. **Data Collection & Analysis** — Load the dataset, explore features, check missing values.  
3. **Data Standardization** — Scale features for optimal model performance.  
4. **Train-Test Split** — Divide dataset into training and testing sets.  
5. **Model Training** — Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.  
6. **Model Evaluation** — Evaluate accuracy on training and test sets.  
7. **Prediction System** — Build a system that predicts diabetes for new input data.  

## Getting Started
